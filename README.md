# -Analysis-of-AI-Adoption-using-ML-Models
ðŸ¤– AI Adoption Analysis using Machine Learning This project analyzes patterns and factors influencing AI adoption across countries and industries using machine learning models. It identifies key drivers, challenges, and strategic levers for successful implementation.




ðŸ“Š Project Overview
Goal: Analyze global AI adoption data to generate actionable insights for policy-makers, industry leaders, and researchers.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data Sources: Kaggle (Gloabal Ai Adoption Dataset)

Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest.

ðŸš€ Key Findings
AI adoption is significantly influenced by infrastructure readiness, sector-specific trust, and human-AI collaboration training.

Countries with higher digital infrastructure investment show stronger alignment between AI adoption and economic performance.

Sectors such as healthcare and law exhibit slower adoption due to regulatory and ethical complexity.

ðŸ§­ Strategic Recommendations
Promote Human-AI Collaboration Training
Develop workforce training programs to support productive collaboration between humans and AI systems.

Build Readiness Before Scaling AI
Ensure digital infrastructure, data governance, and workforce skills are in place before pursuing AI at scale.

Encourage Sector-Specific Regulation
Tailor regulatory approaches for sensitive industries like healthcare and law, balancing innovation and compliance.

Monitor Efficiency, Not Just Adoption
Track metrics like revenue growth, employee trust, and job impact alongside adoption rates for a holistic evaluation.
